_Canvass_ is an open-source, AI-ready, smart grid research toolbox by Sayonsom Chanda, developed while at Washington State University.
The best use case for _Canvass_ is developing new algorithms, simulating new kind of attacks, and observing their impacts on the power system.
This toolkit is for academic and research purposes, and penetration testing of critical power grid infrastructure.


### Why another Power Grid Software? ![alt text](https://img.shields.io/packagist/l/doctrine/orm.svg "Logo Title Text 1")

Very few power system analysis tools are inter-disciplinary in nature.
In the age of smart grids, performing co-simulations of cyber physical power systems are not only necessary, they are required.
Yet, performing such simulations require elaborate setups and two different sets of modeling.
_Canvass_ can fulfill that gap, better than any other open source toolkit available in the market today (2017).

### What can you do with Canvass?

1. Steady-state Power Flow
2. Cyber Attack Simulation for Smart Grid
3. Optimal Power Flow
4. Fault Calculations
5. State Estimation
6. Predict future load demands using recurrent neural networks.
7. Graph Theory Topology Analysis

### How to use _Canvass_?

#### 5-minute quickstart
Try out the example.

#### Details
Coming Soon.

#### Coolest Features

There is actually an `ukraine` mode, in which you can simulate the Ukraine power system attack on the power system model you have.

### How can you build your own modules?

If you are cool with Python, you will start building smart things very easily.
